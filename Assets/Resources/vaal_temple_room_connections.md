## Strategic Planning Tips

### Building Snake Chains
Given the connection restrictions, here are valid patterns:

✅ **Valid Patterns:**
- Path → Garrison → Path → Garrison → Path
- Garrison → Spymaster ← Path (Spymaster as dead-end with one Garrison)
- Armory → Garrison → Commander → Garrison → Armory
- Smithy → Armory → Garrison → Armory → Smithy

❌ **Invalid Patterns:**
- Garrison → Spymaster → Garrison (Spymaster limit)
- Path → Smithy → Golem → Smithy → Golem (alternating restriction)
- Corruption → Garrison (incompatible)

### Key Considerations
1. **Spymaster Placement**: Since Spymaster can only connect to ONE Garrison, it's best used as a branch/dead-end rather than in the middle of chains
2. **Commander Timing**: Place Spymasters BEFORE adding Commanders to your chain
3. **Sacrificial Chamber**: Save this unique room for critical chain connections or merging separated sections
4. **Generator Requirement**: Always ensure Generator has at least one Path connection before placing
5. **Sealed Vault Access**: Plan Path routes specifically to reach Sealed Vaults
